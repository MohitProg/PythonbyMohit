# What is python 
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation, making it an excellent choice for beginners as well as professionals.

## Key Features of Python:
- **Easy to Learn and Use**: Python has a simple syntax that mimics natural language, making it beginner-friendly.

- **Interpreted Language**: Python code is executed line-by-line, which makes debugging easier.

- **Dynamically Typed**: You don’t need to declare data types; Python determines them at runtime.

- **High-Level Language**: You don’t need to manage memory manually or deal with complex hardware-level operations.

- **Portable**: Python code runs on different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) without modification.

- **Extensive Libraries**: Comes with a large standard library and a vast ecosystem of third-party packages (like NumPy, Pandas, Django, Flask, etc.).

- **Object-Oriented and Functional**: Supports both object-oriented and functional programming paradigms.

- **Used in Various Domains**: From web development and data science to AI, machine learning, automation, game development, and more.
