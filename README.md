# What is python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation, making it an excellent choice for beginners as well as professionals.

## Key Features of Python:

- **Easy to Learn and Use**: Python has a simple syntax that mimics natural language, making it beginner-friendly.

- **Interpreted Language**: Python code is executed line-by-line, which makes debugging easier.

- **Dynamically Typed**: You don’t need to declare data types; Python determines them at runtime.

- **High-Level Language**: You don’t need to manage memory manually or deal with complex hardware-level operations.

- **Portable**: Python code runs on different platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) without modification.

- **Extensive Libraries**: Comes with a large standard library and a vast ecosystem of third-party packages (like NumPy, Pandas, Django, Flask, etc.).

- **Object-Oriented and Functional**: Supports both object-oriented and functional programming paradigms.

- **Used in Various Domains**: From web development and data science to AI, machine learning, automation, game development, and more.

## what is variable in a python ? 
Variable is a type of container which is used to save data and data can be any type

## Rules for writing variable name  
- A variable name must start with a letter (A–Z or a–z) or an underscore (_). It cannot start with a digit.

- Variable names can only contain letters, digits (0–9), and underscores (_). Special characters like `@`, `$`, `%`, and spaces are not allowed.

- Variable names are case-sensitive. For example, `name`, `Name`, and `NAME` are treated as different variables.

- Python keywords cannot be used as variable names. Keywords like `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `class`, `def`, etc., are reserved for Python syntax.

- There is no limit on the length of a variable name, but it’s good practice to keep names short, meaningful, and readable.

- Use descriptive names that make your code easy to understand. Avoid using one-letter variables (like `x`, `y`, `z`) unless they are used in a specific context (e.g., loops or math).


## what is data type ? 
Simply data type means in python is that what ever data we are saving and using in python is which type like intyeger , boolean or something else 

### we have two types of datav type in python 
- **Primitive Data type** : these is inbuilt data type in python which used for data alocation 
- **Derived Datta type** : simply when we combine two primitive data type then it become derived data type will discuss about it further 

## type of Primitive data type 
| Type             | Description                                                  | Example           |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Integer          | Whole numbers without a decimal                              | 10, -5, 0         |
| Float / Double   | Numbers with decimal points                                  | 3.14, -0.99       |
| Character (char) | A single character (in languages like Java, C)               | 'A', 'z'          |
| Boolean          | Represents truth values                                       | true, false       |
| String           | A sequence of characters (primitive in some languages)       | "Hello", "123"    |
